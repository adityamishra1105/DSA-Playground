# DSA Playground – My Journey in Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository is a structured collection of my DSA practice in Java. Each concept is categorised into separate folders, making it easier to navigate, understand, and track progress.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is organised topic-wise for clarity and focus:

DSA-Playground
├── Arrays
├── LinkedLists
├── Recursion
├── Trees
├── Graphs
├── Sorting
├── DynamicProgramming
├── README.md
├── .gitignore

Each folder contains Java implementations of relevant algorithms and problems related to that topic.
